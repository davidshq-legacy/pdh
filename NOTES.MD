# NOTES
PDH attempts to provide a concise, focused, best practices, opinioniated guide to building a WordPress plugin. In order to accomplish this numerous alternative ways of accomplishing specific tasks are left aside. In the notes section we attempt to address some of these additional topics. You'll find references to notes throughout the code referenced in this fashion (#nnn) - e.g., (#100).

- (#001) - Relevant PHP built-in functions include: isset(), function_exists(), class_exists(), and defined().
- (#002) - The handbook includes two more examples:
    - https://jjj.blog/2012/12/slash-architecture-my-approach-to-building-wordpress-plugins/
    - https://iandunn.name/content/presentations/wp-oop-mvc/mvc.php#/
- (#003) The handbook includes additional references but they do not appear to be actively maintained and I wouldn't recommend:
    - WordPress Plugin Boilerplate (2014): https://github.com/claudiosanches/wordpress-plugin-boilerplate
    - WP Skeleton Plugin (2014): https://github.com/ptahdunbar/wp-skeleton-plugin
- (#004) Why?
