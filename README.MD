# WP Plugin Developer Handbook Unofficial Reference Plugin
This plugin (aka "PDH") is an attempt to compile in one place a well-documented, best practices guide/reference to building a WordPress plugin.

Currently I've worked my way through the entire [WP Plugin Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/) once, now I'll be going back through the code and cleaning it up, hopefully getting it to be a functional plugin. I'll also continue enhancing using other high quality sources.

FYI: The plugin doesn't currently work. First I'm getting everything/almost everything into the plugin files, then will work on making it functional.

Note: This reference plugin draws extensively on the materials in the WP Developer Handbook including usage of code and text.
