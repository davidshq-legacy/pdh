# WP Plugin Developer Handbook Unofficial Reference Plugin
I'm working my way through the [WP Plugin Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/) and as I do so am using/creating the code and best practices in the handbook to create a reference plugin which I and others can use as a quick reference on creating WP plugins. In the future it may integrate other sources of best practices, but at the moment I'm focusing on the handbook.

FYI: The plugin doesn't currently work. First I'm getting everything/almost everything into the plugin files, then will work on making it functional.
