/**
 * Getting into the WordPress.org Plugin Directory
 *
 * If you want to be listed in WP's official plugin directory you'll need to follow some guidelines.
 *
 * Requirements
 *  - Must be compatible with GPLv2 or later.
 *  - The subversion repo must be used only for functional versions of the plugin.
 *  - Advertising/powered by links, calls to external services are prohibited unless clearly documented and explicit
 * user permission is given.
 *  - Must not do anything illegal, dishonest, or morally offensive.
 *  - Plugins must use the libraries (e.g. jQuery) included with WP rather than packaging their own with the plugin.
 *  - Plugins must be secure.
 *  - Include a readme.txt.
 *
 * Please see the Developer Handbook for a much more extensive treatment of this process, it is not covered in detail
 * here.
